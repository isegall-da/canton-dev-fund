## Abstract

Today, on-chain SV governance is tightly coupled with node
operations. Every node has a single on-ledger vote, and only the
SV operator party can submit votes (and vote requests) on behalf of that
node. This introduces operational complexities for SV operators (who often
need to seek approval to vote within their organizations from business owners),
as well as a security risk by reusing the same operator (internal) party for
all votes.

This proposal introduces a mechanism through which (external) parties
can be delegated by the node operator to be able to vote on behalf of the node,
and a dApp UI through which they can perform that. The delegee can choose to
host their own dApp UI, or use one hosted by the SV node for them. This
proposal takes over the remaining work out of XXX, which was discontinued after
delivering Milestone 2. The starting point for this proposal is therefore M2
in the above referenced one.

## Specification

### 1. Objective

Develop and deliver a mechanism for an SV node operator to delegate SV
governance voting to non-operator parties, which may also be an external party
and hosted on a different validator node, and a dApp for them to do so.
While this is a step toward separating governance from node operations, it intentionally
does not modify the voting rights (which remain one vote per node), only adds an additional
party that is allowed to vote on behalf of the node, and the capability for them to use
any CIP-103 compliant wallet provider to do so via a governance dApp.

### 2. Implementation Mechanics

This proposal will be implemented via changes in various components of Splice, as follows.

#### Daml

Complete the introduction of a voting delegation workflow. A node operator may delegate
governance voting to any party. The contract is a standard Daml delegation contract, where
the node operator permits a certain "voter party" to vote on behalf of the node. It does
not affect the operator's ability to vote, only adds a workflow in which the voter party
may also submit votes and vote requests, which are registered on-ledger as the node's votes
(with a public record that they were submitted via the delegation).

To be explicit, this is the same Daml code funded in M2 of the previous grant mentioned
above, and availble in the [feature fork](https://github.com/canton-network/splice-sv-voting-dapp/commit/00a2bad8825e62a48096d780421411df6ea92b20#diff-d109e7b29a999dd8e985074e683c151f7fc922eb6e8297d4d7150e475ccb5f4f) already.
The funding in this grant includes only a final round of review and hardening for
prod-readiness, and the work for preparing and submitting the CIP required for the code
changes to be adopted, which was not completed under the previous grant up to the point
where it was discontinued.

#### Governance dApp

The existing SV UI is tightly coupled with the SV node operator, and is usable only with
a user that has act-as rights for the SV node operator's party. Moreover, that party must
be a participant-internal party. This grant will introduce a governance dApp that would
allow a user with rights on the voter party to submit the votes using the delegation via
any CIP-103 compliant wallet.

The dApp does not assume any access to the SV app's APIs.
The read path uses Scan APIs for fetching data, and the write path goes via the CIP-103
compliant wallet to any participant that hosts the voter party.

The SV UI implementation will be refactored to support both modes:
- When deployed in "non-dapp mode" mode, it will retain the current behavior.
- When deployed in "voter" mode, it will:
  - Use scan for the read path and CIP-103 wallet APIs for the write path.
  - Hide functionality that is not relevant/supported for voter parties, like
    issuing secrets for onboarding validators, and coin-price related functionalities.
  - Hide/disable other functionalities that are clearly intended for node operators
    only, e.g. specific configuration parameters that affect only the node operations.
    The precise details for which functionality is included under this item will be
    determined as part of implementation, and will be easily modified over time as
    the needs change.
  - Support a single voter party having delegations from multiple nodes, and choosing
    per each action (e.g. every time a vote is cast) on behalf of which node the vote
    should be cast.

Note that in terms of implementation, a single implementation will support both modes,
to minimize discrepencies between the two, and support long-term maintenance of both.
However, the same implementation will support the two distinct modes, and at deployment
time, the two UIs will behave differently as configured at deployment time.

Since the dApp mode of the UI does not rely on connectivity to the SV app, it may be hosted
either by the node operator (alongside the UI they host for themselves as operators), or
independently by the voter (or by a 3rd party on their behalf). Both options will be
supported, tested and documented.

#### Deployment

Splice SV node deployment tooling, i.e. the Splice node Helm charts, will be augmented
to support (optionally) deploying the SV governance dApp UI. The same chart will be
available also for independent hosting of said UI outside of the SV node. Documentation
for both modes of deployment will be provided.


### 3. Architectural Alignment

This proposal aligns with multiple initiatives in the canton ecosystem, namely:

- Improving governance processes by allowing business owners to participate directly in
  on-ledger governance without relying on SV node operators to cast votes on their behalf.
- Improving security by separating concerns, and allowing users and parties with well-defined
  responsibilities and permissions to act.
- Reducing reliance on internal parties, and increasing support for external parties acting
  via CIP-103 compliant wallets.

### 4. Backward Compatibility

This proposal is fully backward compatible. It is a pure incrememntal functionality,
which adds the ability for an external voter to vote on bahelf of the node. All available
functionalities for the node operator are untouched and unaffected in this proposal.

## Milestones and Deliverables

### Milestone 1: Community Acceptance
- **Estimated Delivery:**
  - 6 weeks after grant approval
- **Focus:**
  - Core functionality implemented in Daml, and accepted by the community via a CIP
- **Deliverables / Value Metrics:**
  - Daml code is complete enough to be voted on in a CIP
  - CIP written, submitted and accepted

### Milestone 2: Production Readiness
- **Estimated Delivery:**
  - 12 weeks after grant approval
- **Focus:**
  - Full development, testing and documentation of the feature
- **Deliverables / Value Metrics:**
  - Complete implementation, hardening and testing, including:
    - Add support and documentation for node operators to configure their voting delegates
      as part of their deployment.
    - Add support and documentation for SV node operators, or any other hosting service,
      to host the voting UI for the voting delegates.
    - Add support for a single party being the governance voting party for more than
      one SV node.
      At submission time, the user can choose on behalf of which node they are voting.
    - SV dApp UI supports the `governance` tab from the existing SV UI,
      but hides all other functionality (which is either broken or irrelevant
      for voting parties).
    - Identify the parameters in votes that are clearly node operations-specific,
      and hide/disable changing them via the dApp UI.
    - Happy-path and error-path testing complete, code is production-ready
    - SV dApp UI submits all transaction via standard CIP-103 wallet APIs, and tested
      against a standard-compliant wallet, e.g. the Wallet Gateway.
  - Functionality is presented and demonstrated to the SV node operators.
  - Deployment and usage fully documented in the canton-network public documentation.
  - All code is merged into Splice main, ready for release in the following minor release.

### Milestone 3: Rollout and Adoption
- **Estimated Delivery:**
  - 22 weeks after grant approval
- **Focus:**
  - Rollout of the feature across all networks, and adoption by SVs.
- **Deliverables / Value Metrics:**
  - Daml Model versions are voted in on DevNet, TestNet and MainNet, and the feature is
    available for use by SV nodes.
  - At least two different SV node operators configuring delegation to voting parties and
    submitting at least one vote or vote request each as a delegate via the dApp.

## Co-Marketing
Upon release, the implementing entity will collaborate with the Foundation on:

- Announcement coordination
- Case study or technical blog
- Developer or ecosystem promotion

---

## Motivation

This proposal is a concrete next step in the path toward decoupling SV node operations
from governance. It is a well-defined concrete step that allows organizations to already
decouple these responsibilities, without yet touching the core governance questions of
weighted votes, rewards, etc. As such, it improves operational processes in SV organizations
in a purely additive manner.

---

## Rationale

dApps are the standard method for supporting external parties acting on the Canton Network.
Therefore, designing the voting app as a dApp enables that. The delegation process allows
adding another party that can act on behalf of the node in the context of voting, but does
not subtract any existing functionality from the operator party. This allows this proposal
to be tightly scoped and low-risk.
